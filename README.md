# Employee Tracker

## Description
An application where the user can keep track of employees. The database will keep track of departments, roles, and employees. The user can view all databases, employees under a specific manager or department, and the total salary of all employees under a specific department. The user can also add, update, and delete any departments, roles, and employees.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Inquirer.js
* MySQL
* Dotenv

## Usage
When starting the application, it will first show a main menu that will give the user an option to either view, update, add, delete, or quit. Each section, expect for quit, will have more options that will allow the user to update the database as they wish. Each menu will also have a 'Go back' option to prevent the user from getting stuck on any part of the application. After completing a function, the prompt will ask the user if they wish to return to main menu or quit. This allows the application to close without the user needing to hard close the program.
